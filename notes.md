Hacking skills: Tech skills, creativity
Statistics: choose procedures, diagnose problems, develop procedures


The wrangling: 
Sample The data: Random, Stratified, 
reduce dimensionality: irrelevant input variables
Reconcile missing data: Discard, infer
reduce dimensionality: irrelevant input variables, redundant input variables
add derivatives values: generalize attributes, discretize attributes to categories binarize categorical attributes
Normalize numeric values: Standard unit of measure, subtract average (mean =0), divide by standard deviation
design training data: Select, combine, aggregate
power and log transformation: Approximate normal distribution
