    "* Ways to reduce complexity of the model:\n",
    "* $Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X_1 + \\beta_2X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_pX_p + \\epsilon$\n",
    "    1. **Subset Selection** - choose subset of $p$ predictors\n",
    "    2. **Regularization** - keep $p$ predictors, shrink coefficient estimates towards 0 (some variable selection for lasso)\n",
    "    3. **Dimensionality Reduction** - project $p$ predictors into $M$-dimensional space where $M<p$\n",
    "* Subset selection techniques:\n",
    "    1. **Best subset** - try every model with every possible combination of $p$ predictors\n",
    "        * (-) computationally intensive (huge search space), especially for large amount of $p$\n",
    "        * (+) higher chance of finding models that look good on training data (low bias)\n",
    "        * (-) have little predictive power on future data (high variance) \n",
    "    2. **Stepwise selection** - in each step, a variable is considered for addition to or subtraction from $p$ to model $M$ with some criterion\n",
    "        * e.g. $M_0 \\rightarrow M_1 \\rightarrow M_2 \\rightarrow \\dots \\rightarrow M_p$\n",
    "            * where $M_1$ adds one predictor with smallest $RSS$ or largest $R^2$\n",

    "* Best ways to determine best model between multiple models:\n",
    "    1. **Cross-validation** - assesses how well a model will generalize without losing significant modelling or testing capabilites (not 70%/30% split technique). It combines averages measure of fit (prediction error) to derive a more accurate estimate of model prediction performance (k-fold cross-validation).\n",
    "    2. **Mallow's $C_p$** - takes into consideration residual sum of squares, number of predictors, and estimate of variance associated with each response in linear model\n",

    "        * small value of $C_p$ means that model is relatively precise\n",
    "        * (-) $C_p$ approximation is only valid for large sample size\n",
    "        * (-) $C_p$ cannot handle complex collections of models as in the variable selection or feature selection problem\n",
    "    3. **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)** - an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. It deals with trade-off between goodness of fit and simplicity of model\n",
    "        * equation: $AIC = -2logL+2\\underline{p}$ (minimize)\n",

    "        * can show that AIC and Mallow's $C_p$ are equivalent for linear case\n",
    "    4. **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)** - similar to AIC, it considers like likelihood and # of parameters. The difference is that BIC penalization is larger than AIC.\n",
    "        * equation: $BIC = \\frac{1}{n}(RSS+log(n)\\underline{p}\\hat{\\sigma}^2)$ (minimize)\n",
    "        * similar to AIC, except $2$ is replaced by $log(n)$\n",
    "        * Generally, BIC exacts heavier penalty for more variables\n",
    "            * $log(n) > 2$ for $n>7$\n",
    "        * BIC assumes that data distribution is an exponential family\n",
    "        * (-) BIC is only valid for sample size $n$ much larger than the number of $k$ of parameters in the model\n",
    "        * (-) BIC cannot handle complex collections of models as in the variable selection or feature selection problem in high-dimension\n",
